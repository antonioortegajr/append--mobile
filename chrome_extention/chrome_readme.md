Read me for Chrome.

This extension is working on the latest version of chrome.

To install  Go to tools > extensions > check on Developer Mode > Load Unpacked Extension install unzipped folder.

When enabled and active based on the url string, the small image in this repo should appear in the url bar. Although I have had issues with the image disappearing for no reason.

This did also work in the chromium based Opera.
