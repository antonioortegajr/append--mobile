These browser extensions (or add ons) append the current url based on a pre defined portion of the url string being present. Then also pre defined appendage is appended and run.

The appendage is preceded by a ? when a ? is not present in the current url string.

If a ? is present an & is used.

This occurs before the DOM loads.

Built for Chrome and Firefox

Mobile is used as the appendage in this example.

The Chrome extension I am currently using. This also worked in the nerwer chromium Opera.

The firefox version did work last I used which was some time ago as I prefer chrome.
