These browser extension (or add ons) append the current url based on a pre defined portion of the url string being present. Then also pre defined appendage is appended and run.

The appendage is preceded by a ? when a ? is not present in the current url string.

IF a ? is present an & is used.

This occurs before the DOM loads.
