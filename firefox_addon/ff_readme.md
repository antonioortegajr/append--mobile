Read me for firefox.

This add has not been tested on the latest version of firefox. I don't use ff that much anymore. Additionally this was created prior to the changes in add on development from Mozilla.

Install by zipping the file. Change the .zip to .xpi and open with firefox.

To rebuild this add on should it not function use: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK
